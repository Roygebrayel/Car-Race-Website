# CAR RACE PROJECT

- this website is about registration into a viewer race and registration as a driver

- we've used HTML to structure the website also CSS to design the website and json to config the website
also a new language we've learned php that enables us to connect the database into a website interface

- we've also included all sql queries (DDL and DML) into a folder named sql.

## ORGANIZATION

- we've also made a folder and we insert in it all design files including logical data module and relational data module.

- we've used a software called smartDraw that enables us to design all entities in a simple method ( the extension of the file is .sdr so to open it you should import it to the smartDraw website)
